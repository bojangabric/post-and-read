## Web app for posting and reading articles using React.js

- Built REST API using Express.js and mongoose
- Integrated Cloudinary for easier storing and retrieving pictures
- Added markdown for making posts more eye-pleasing

### REST API

Currently supports:

- **/**
  - GET - returns all articles
  - POST - add an article
- **/:id**
  - GET - finds an article by id and returns it
